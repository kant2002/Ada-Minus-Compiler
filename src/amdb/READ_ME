This directory contains the sources of the ada debugger,and directories
for manual and help pages(menus and manual).
It uses for compilation files from '../das' and '../share'(see makefile).
The debugger(adadb) is actually a sourceline tracer so the values of variables
are not available.
Bugs are however available for anyone who wants to get involved too deeply.
A number of 'problem reports' can be found in the file '../ddb_errors'.

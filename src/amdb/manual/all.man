     The 'all' command lists the called subprograms or elaborated
     packages for each library unit.
     Subprograms not called or packages not  elaborated  are  not
     listed.
     After each subprogram or package name the  number  of  times
     the  subprogram  is  called  or the package is elaborated is
     printed.


     Example:


                         main:
                         MAIN-> 1
                         MAIN.PROGRAM-> 1


     The example above shows you that for instance package 'main'
     has  been elaborated once and procedure 'program' within the
     body of package main has been called once.

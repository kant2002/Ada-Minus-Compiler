     The 'after' command (re)starts or continues the DAS  program
     but interrupts the program after number events are executed.
     If less then number events are executed but an exception  is
     raised  the program is also interrupted.  The number entered
     must be greater than zero.  If the number entered  is  equal
     to zero nothing will happen.
     The 'after' command has as a side effect that previously set
     trace or break points at certain events are ignored (but not
     deleted).

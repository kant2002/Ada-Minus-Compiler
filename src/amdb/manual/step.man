     The 'step' command  starts or continues the DAS program.  If
     the state of the DAS program is fetched, terminated, aborted
     or killed the program is started, in  any  other  state  the
     program is continued.
     As soon as the program has executed an event or an exception
     is  raised  the DAS program is interrupted (state is break),
     the output region displays the event or  exception  and  the
     debugger will be back in control.

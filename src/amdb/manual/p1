.H 1 "Tutorial"
The following two chapters in this manual explain the usage of
.B ddb ,
a symbolic debugger for programs written in the DAS (Delft Ada Subset)
programming language.
Chapter 1 describes step by step how the debugger can be used to 
follow the execution of a DAS program when the program or procedure to be
followed is compiled with the :-d: flag.
Chapter 2 lists all the available commands in a more formal way.
.P
It is assumed that the reader of this tutorial is familiar with
ADA specific terms.
The terms specific to the symbolic debugger will be
explained when first encountered in the text.
.H 2 "Usage"
.P
The symbolic debugger must be called as
.sp 1
.ce
ddb [filename] [ -m masterfile]
.sp 1
where filename is the unix name of the sourcefile of a compiled and
loaded unit.The .ada suffix of that name can be omitted.
The second argument is only necessary when the name of the masterfile 
differs from ".master".
.br
When filename is omitted or the corresponding unit is not accessible,compiled
or loaded,the program will ask for the 
.B unit
name.Typing e <return> will return to the shell.
When the unit is accepted and the necessary data has been fetched,
your terminal screen should have
the following layout:
.sp 2
.in +4
.DS 0 1
\f2mode\f1    main       \f2program\f1 <unit name>  \f2use\f1 <unit_name>
		     \f2state\f1   fetched
.br
.B
enter command
.R
.br
Commands: A(fter B(reak C(at D(elete E(xit H(elp L(ist
.br
          M(enu  R(un S(tep T(race W(ith ^d ^l
.br
.sp 10
.FG "screen layout"
.DE
.in -4
.sp 
.P
The terminal screen is divided now in two regions.
The first six lines are called the
.B
status region
.R
and is reserved to display status information about the DAS program being
debugged and for the user to give his commands.
The rest of the screen is called the
.B
output region
.R
and is reserved for output generated by the DAS program and output of the
symbolic debugger that cannot be listed in the status region.
.P
The third line of the status region is called the
.B
command line
.R
and is
reserved for the display of prompts from the debugger and error messages.
.H 2 "Modes"
.P
The debugger will always be in one of six possible states or
.B modes .
The mode you are in at a certain moment is called the
.B
current mode.
.R
The current mode is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
When you enter the debugger '
.B mode
main' should be displayed there (see figure 1).
In each mode only those commands listed in the
.B menu ,
the words after Commands on the fourth line of your screen,
are available (see figure 1).
To give a command only the first letter of the
command has to be typed (not terminated by a return).
.P
The six modes you can be in are main, run, print, trace, break and delete mode.
Some of the commands available in a mode have as effect that another
mode is entered.
The arrows in figure 2 point to the modes that become the current mode.
For example, if you want to go to trace mode from main mode, the 'trace'
command should be given.
.DF
.sp 30
.FG "Modes"
.DE
.P
Whenever you want to return to the mode you were in before the current one,
type a <return>.
In some modes you have to type several <return>'s to get back in main mode.
A shorter way is the
.B quit
command which will return you to the main mode from any other mode.
The 'quit' command is available in all modes but has no visible effect when used
in main mode, for that reason it is not listed in the menu of the main mode.
.H 2 "Help facility"
.P
As mentioned in the previous section each mode has its own set of available commands.
Although the commands are listed in the menu it is not always clear 
what they will do, especially to an unexperienced user.
To aid in the understanding of the commands every mode has a
.B help
command.
If you give this command all available commands in the current
mode are listed in
the output region, with a short description of their function.
.P
Figure 3 shows the screen after a 'help' command has been given in
the main mode.
Although figure 3 does not show all commands in the output
region your terminal screen should show them all.

COMMANDS IN MAIN MODE
.sp
A(fter     -- execute DAS program 'number events
.br
B(reak     -- set break points
.br
C(at       -- list library unit
.br
D(elete    -- delete previously set trace and break points
.br
E(xit	   -- return to your DAPSE (same as ^d)
.br
L(ist  	   -- list DAS library
.sp 3
.FG "help screen"
.DE
.in -3
.P
Note that the help command displays on the second line of your
screen '
.B command
help'.
You will always get a response after a correct command has been given
because each command will echo its 'activation' on the second line of the screen.
.P
Commands that need more information to work on will display a prompt on
the command line to enter the information.
The 'help'
command i.e. displays the prompt
.B
enter command name
.R
(see figure 3).
.br
Every commmand offers you two choices at this point:
.AL
.LI
you enter the information,
terminated by a <return>.
If the given information is correct the command will do whatever it is
supposed to do.
Some commands (like the 'help' command) will not terminate and display
another prompt.
.LI
you type a single <return> thereby terminating the command.
This way of terminating the command is very similar to returning to
a previous mode.
.LE
.P
The help command is one of the commands that need more information from
you.
If there still remain some questions you can enter the full name
of the command after the prompt
.B
enter command name
.R
(see figure 3).
As a response you will get a more detailed description of the command.
.P
When the help page for a command is too long to be displayed entirely
in the output region, the lower left corner of your screen will have
the word 'more' displayed in reverse video.
By typing the character 'q' you terminate the listing,
by typing any other character you continue the listing of the help page.
.P
You may also enter names of commands not available in the current mode.
.H 3 "The menu"
.P
Experienced users of the debugger do not always need the menu
when they enter a well known mode.
The
.B menu
command (available in every mode) clears or displays the menu
, depending on whether the menu was displayed
or not.
When the menu part is cleared the output region on your screen will be
enlarged by the lines previously occupied by the menu.
.P
As only the menu of the current mode is affected
the 'menu' command must be given in every mode to clear or display the menu of that mode.
When you reenter a mode, it has been remembered if you want the menu or not.
Initialy menus are always listed.
.H 2 "Error messages"
.P
In certain situations an error message will be displayed on the command line.
If you should give for instance a nonexisting command the error message '
.B error
illegal command, type <return>'
would appear.
The only way to respond to an error message is by typing a
.ul 1
single 
<return>.
If you type any other character(s) before the <return> no action is taken.
This is done to prevent fast typists from missing the error message.
.H 2 "The DAS library"
.P
The
.B list
and
.B cat
commands allow you to examine the DAS program library (see 1.1).
The 'list' command will give a listing of all library units in the DAS
library.
.P
The 'cat' command will give a source listing of a library unit specified
after the prompt
.B enter unit.
The full unit name should be given e.g. for a package "test" you
should specify "test.test",and for a subunit "subp" from package test "
"test.subp".
.br
When the specified library unit is found in the DAS library the source is listed
with line numbers.

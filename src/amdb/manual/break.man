     The 'break' command changes the current mode to break  mode.
     The  commands  available  in the break mode allow you to set
     break points at the entry and exit of subprograms, the start
     and  ending  of  the  elaboration  of  package  bodies,  the
     execution of statements and exceptions.
     By setting break points at certain events or exceptions  the
     debugger  will  prompt  for  a command whenever the event is
     executed or an exception is raised during execution  of  the
     DAS program.
     The executed  event  or  the  raising  of  an  exception  is
     displayed in the output region.

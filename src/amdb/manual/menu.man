     The 'menu' command will clear the list  of  commands  or  it
     will display the list of commands in the status region.  The
     menu command must be given in every mode to clear or display
     the  menu  of  that mode.  If at one time you reenter a mode
     that mode remembers if the menu should be listed.
     The absence of a menu will enlarge your output region  while
     the presence of a menu will reduce your output region.

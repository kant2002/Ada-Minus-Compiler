     The help command will  begin  with  a  listing  of  all  the
     commands   possible   in  the  current  mode  with  a  short
     description.  If you need more help you may enter a  command
     name which will give you a longer description of the command
     (such as this one).
     If in the lower left corner of your screen the word more  in
     reverse  video appears you can type the single character 'q'
     to quit the listing or any other character to  continue  the
     listing of the command.
     Help pages for commands available only in other  modes  than
     the current one can be listed too.

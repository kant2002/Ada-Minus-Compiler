     The 'context' displays the context of an executed  statement
     in exactly the same way as the 'cont' command does it.
     Be aware that the 'context' command does not execute the DAS
     program like the 'cont' command.
     The 'context' command is only usable when the last  executed
     event was the execution of a statement.

     last event is not the execution of a statement

_S_E_E _A_L_S_O

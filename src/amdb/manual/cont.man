     The  'cont'  command  executes  the  program  one  event  or
     exception  at  the  time.  In this way it is very similar to
     the 'step' command.  The 'cont'  command  differs  with  the
     'step'  command  when  a  statement  has been executed.  The
     'step' command displays only the  source  of  the  statement
     while  the  Context means here the lines textually preceding
     and following the executed  statement.   The  executed  line
     itself is enclosed between dashed lines.

     The 'trace' command will change the current  mode  to  trace
     mode.   In  the trace mode there are commands that allow you
     to set trace  points  at  subprogram  calls  and  subprogram
     exits,  the  start  and  end  of  the elaboration of package
     bodies and exceptions.
     The commands used in the trace mode to set trace  points  on
     events  and  exceptions all need the name of a subprogram or
     package.  The notation used to  enter  these  names  is  the
     selected component notation.


     EXAMPLE :

            PPROCEDURE test IS
                    PROCEDURE black IS
                            PACKAGE box IS
                                    -- types and objects of box;
                            END box;
                            PACKAGE BODY box IS
                            BEGIN
                                    -- statements of box;
                            END box;
                    BEGIN
                            -- statements of black;
                    END black;
            BEGIN
                    -- statements of test;
            END test;


     The name of package box in selected  component  notation  is
     'test.black.box'  .   The  name  of procedure black would be
     'test.black' while that of procedure test is simply 'test'.

     In this simple example we can easily name all subprogram and
     packages  but  in  real  life  the  DAS  programs are not so
     simple.  With most DAS programs it would thus  take  a  long
     time to name all subprograms and packages.

     To prevent this long and boring task the effect of naming  a
     particular  subprogram  or  package is to implicitly include
     all the subprograms and packages declared in the declarative
     part of the explicitly named subprogram or package.

     So instead of naming all subprograms  and  packages  in  the










TRACE                      Adb manual                       TRACE


     example it would have been enough to enter only 'test' after
     the prompt, thus setting trace points in all bodies.

     On the other hand it will not always be  necessary  to  have
     trace  or  break  points on all subprograms or packages in a
     declarative part but only on a single subprogram or package.
     To  indicate  this name the particular subprogram or package
     by the selected component notation  and  append  as  a  last
     component '<>'.

     Entering the name 'test.black.<>' would set  only  trace  or
     break points in the body of package 'black'.

     There are four special characters that can be  used  as  the
     first  or  perhaps  only component.  These characters can be
     seen as macro's.  The four characters are:

      1.  !
          the exclaim character will  expand  to  the  unit  name
          given  after  _u_s_e in the status region.  This unit name
          may be changed by the 'use' command.

      2.  #
          the immediate  character  will  expand  to  the  active
          library  unit  name.   The  active  library unit is the
          first (or  perhaps  only)  component  in  the  selected
          component  name  displayed  after  the  word  _i_n on the
          status region.

      3.  $
          the dollar character expands to the selected  component
          name  given after the word _i_n on the status region.  In
          effect this is the active subprogram or package.

      4.  *
          the star character may only be used as  the  first  and
          only  component  in the name.  The effect of its use is
          to set trace or break points  in  all  subprograms  and
          packages of the DAS program.

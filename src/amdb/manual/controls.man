     The control character ^d (control-d) will exit the  debugger
     and  return to your DAPSE.  The ^d command is similar to the
     'exit' command but is  available  in  all  modes  while  the
     'exit' command is not available in all modes.


     The control character ^c (control-c)  interrupts  a  running
     DAS  program  as  soon as an event or exception is executed.
     An interrupted program has state 'interrupted'.

     ^c is an illegal command when the DAS program is not running.

_S_E_E _A_L_S_O

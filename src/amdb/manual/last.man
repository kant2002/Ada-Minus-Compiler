     The 'last' command lists the last 15  subprogram  calls  and
     package  elaborations.   The  most resent subprogram call or
     package elaboration is given first in the listing, the  last
     but  one  call  or elaboration is given as the second in the
     listing, and so on.
     Be aware that this is only a history of the last 15 calls or
     elaborations  so  the  listing  does  not reflect the active
     subprograms and packages.

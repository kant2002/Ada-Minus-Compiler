     The 'stack' command lists the active subprogram or  packages
     with  the  most  recently called subprogram or package given
     first.  The name of a body in the listing determines  if  it
     is  the  name  of  a  subprogram  or  package.   The name is
     displayed in the selected component notation (see  also  the
     help page for the 'trace' command).

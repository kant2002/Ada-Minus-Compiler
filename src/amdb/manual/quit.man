     The 'quit' command will change  the  current  mode  to  main
     mode.
     To change the current mode to main you normally  would  have
     to  type several return's.  The 'quit' command will have the
     same effect as typing several return's returning immediately
     to main mode without entering previous modes.
     Although the 'quit' command may be given in main mode it has
     no  visible  effect  and  is therefor not listed in the main
     menu.

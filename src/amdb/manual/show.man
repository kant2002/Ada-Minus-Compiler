     The use of the 'show' command is identical  to  the  'lines'
     command in break mode.  When the 'lines' command is used the
     only source line displayed in the output  region  after  the
     execution of a statement would be the source line containing
     the executed statement.
     When  the  'show'  command  is  used  the   lines   textualy
     preceeding  and  following  the  source  line containing the
     executed statement are also displayed.  The source line with
     the executed statement is enclosed between dashed lines.

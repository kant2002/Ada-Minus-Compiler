 * verifies that the (sub)type pointed at by tp has been visited;
 * if not, it causes it to be visited before returning.
 * Care has been taken not to get into infinite recursion (because
 * a visit may cause a call to typeref again).
 * 
 * Typeref is called from two contexts:
 * 1. acctype ():	Acctype will only call typeref if the accessed
 * 		type is an access type (and thus can be visited
 * 		without harm); on recursive (access) type dependence
 * 		stop the recursion by allocating the ultimate
 * 		global access type descriptor.
 * 2. others:	The type referenced can be any type which must
 * 		have been visited before return to the caller;
 * 		if it is not an access type and it is busy (=
 * 		being visited) after all, it must be the case
 * 		that there is a recursive type dependence without
 * 		any intermediate access type, which is an error.
 * The "busy stack" of locals being visited always has the following
 * structure:
 * 	{ structured_type }*  { access_type }*  { scalar_type }*
 * where the top is on the right. Growing the stack stops for a
 * non-access type local when there is nothing to visit anymore,
 * for an access type when the referenced filter references an(other)
 * access type (and thus the current access type will use that access
 * type's representation), for a scalar type (visited from bittyperef
 * from an access type) when the type chain ends, or in any case
 * when a busy local must be visited again.
